# Customer Segmentation Using K-means and PCA

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the development of K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithms to perform data segmentation on a customer dataset. The dataset includes behavioral variables of customers such as Balance, Purchases, etc. The goal is to build a model that segments customers into clusters based on these behavioral variables.
